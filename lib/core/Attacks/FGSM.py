    """
    Applies the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to perturb an image.

    FGSM is an attack that uses the gradients of the loss with respect to the input image to create a new image that maximizes the loss. This method is aimed to fool models by perturbing the original image just enough to deceive the models but not too much to be noticeable by human eyes.

    Args:
    image (torch.Tensor): The original input image.
    epsilon (float): The perturbation factor, often a small number, that scales the gradient's sign. This controls the magnitude of the perturbations applied to the image.
    data_grad (torch.Tensor): The gradients of the loss with respect to the input image. This indicates the direction to modify the pixels.

    Returns:
    torch.Tensor: The perturbed image. This image is clipped to ensure all values are within the [0,1] range, assuming the original image was also normalized to this range.

    Note:
    The function assumes that the input image and the gradients are torch tensors and that the operations are performed with PyTorch.
